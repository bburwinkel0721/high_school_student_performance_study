# Students Performance Data Analysis  

This project analyzes the **Students Performance Dataset**, sourced from Kaggle, to explore trends and patterns in students' academic performance based on various demographic and socio-economic factors.  

## Dataset  

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset/data?select=Student_performance_data+_.csv).  
It contains the following key features:  
- **Gender**: Gender of the student  
- **Parental level of education**: Parents' highest level of education  
- **Lunch**: Type of lunch (e.g., standard or free/reduced)  
- **Test preparation course**: Completion status of the test preparation course  
- **Math score**: Math test scores  
- **Reading score**: Reading test scores  
- **Writing score**: Writing test scores  

## Objectives  

This project aims to:  
1. Explore relationships between demographic factors and test scores.  
2. Identify trends and correlations between subjects.  
3. Provide actionable insights into factors affecting student performance.  

## Tools and Technologies  

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis  

## Steps  

1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze distributions of scores.  
   - Examine relationships between features and performance metrics.  

3. **Visualization**:  
   - Create visual representations of key findings.  

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:  
   - Summarize findings and propose recommendations.
